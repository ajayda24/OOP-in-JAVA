Inheritance :

Inheritance is the mechanism by which an object acquires the some/all properties of another object.
It supports the concept of hierarchical classification.
For example: Car is a four wheeler vehicle so assume that we have a class FourWheeler and a sub class of it named Car. 
Here Car acquires the properties of a class FourWheeler. Other classifications could be a jeep, tempo, van etc. 
FourWheeler defines a class of vehicles that have four wheels, and specific range of engine power, load carrying 
capacity etc. Car (termed as a sub-class) acquires these properties from FourWheeler, and has some specific properties, 
which are different from other classifications of FourWheeler, such as luxury, comfort, shape, size, usage etc.

A car can have further classification such as an open car, small car, big car etc, which will acquire the properties 
from both Four Wheeler and Car, but will still have some specific properties. This way the level of hierarchy can 
be extended to any level.
