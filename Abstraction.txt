OOPS :

It is about developing an application around its data, i.e. objects which provides 
the access to their properties and the possible operations in their own way.

Abstraction :

One of the most fundamental concept of OOPs is Abstraction. Abstraction is a process 
where you show only “relevant” data and “hide” unnecessary details of an object from
the user. For example, when you login to your Amazon account online, you enter your 
user_id and password and press login, what happens when you press login, how the input
data sent to amazon server, how it gets verified is all abstracted away from the you.
